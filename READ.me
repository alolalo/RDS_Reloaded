# RevolverDS: Just Lock, Load & Ship IT!

RevolverDS uses a "NO Docs, STRICTLY Design Principles" approach in which everything just works as advertised in the comments. Testing included! Look at this debug-function I created using ;

```
// Append the modifier suffix and call the function again with the modified color if it fails the test. For production purposes this can be removed since it never runs, but for debugging this will generate the bugs by suffixing _m if it fails during one of your own Sass functions. 
    $new-color: $modified-color + $modifier + '_m';
    @return color-contrast-adjustment($new-color, $contrast, $modifier);
``` 
Because all in all; RevolverDS is "just a bunch of tokens, JIT". But using the mindset and methods of procedurally generating the "Game World" of RevolverDS, it works as my most trusted ally in the front-end. Because it uses my own designed language that is very easy to follow for low-coders and pro-coders alike. I'm not the judge of that, ChatGPT is because it understood it so well.

# Introduction
Hello People! My name is justgu.us, and I created this design system in co-operation with ChatFRIDAY. An Ai powered ChatGPT client that helped me tremendously creating the Sass functions & mixins, as well as help me set up a node.js based project so I can focus on being what I do best: DO-dillegence

RevolverDS uses BOUM-tokens, which I designed and tailored to perfection so I could use one way of naming things system-wide, that can be interpreted as easily by humans as well as Ai. And here's why; language is technology and I am an independant contractor who needs every bit of help he can get.

I would have never written the Sass myself, it's way too cool to learn how it works based on your own design system principles and foundation. I've been using it in design work for quite some time, created my own licensing model so I could protect all the work I create with BOUM-tokens. 

BOUM-tokens are the living and breathing embodyment of BEM, applied to a semantical construct to ramp & scale design tokens like colors, typography, sizing-things, spacings, scales, you name it! I designed it specifically for design system engineering, using RevolverDS as the flagship of progression.

It's incredibly simple to use semantically between people (and Ai). Simply start from a token's Base value, and just think; do I need a token On or Under this Base value? And just step up your game and dial up a token, because what can go wrong? You liked the control of it, but not the result?

This is why Ai really helped out, because honestly; if I didn't know exactly what to prompt it for, it felt more like I was handholding an intern who was overenthousiastically CRUD-ing all of my input for it's own sake of learning. Really, it's biased like that; to teach you how it would like it itself. 

I found that I had to specifically ask NOT to use anything but my imput. So I used a lot of my own code to make it work, and that's something most people don't do. They let Ai do ALL the work for them, not the work they can't complete or simply don't have the time to learn like I do. I know Sass, I can't program it. But I love CSS so there you have it; grit.

But that said, it does understand that and so you can learn that too; how to work with Ai and understand things from a DEV-ops point of view like yours. 

# Questions? Just askgu.us 
So I hope we can get PSY-ops in the air as a valid field of engineering, where we as professional developers and designers once again get back together as "web masters" if we take Ai for a spin to "bridge the gap". And language is a very, very important gap that most design systems forget. That's one of the reasons why RevolverDS and BOUM refer to models everyone knows; guns & trees (and roses #Ikabana)

# Info: BOUM-tokens & BOUM-license
I use my own freemium licensing model to keep my work safe from the use of Ai, because I believe wholeheartedly that Ai can be an aid to people's work using other people's work that openly consented to their work being used. BOUM-tokens actually do just that; create a kind of cookie that you inject into your work, so Ai can be trained to NOT use your asset as feed.

For more information, please visit https://followgu.us/license to read the BOUM-license, and see the FREEmium business model that does not rip a whole in your pocket for giving you your own licensing and distribution rights for FREE, FOREVER! Yes, you don't have to pay a dime unless you are actually making a dime by having enough people View, Install or Print (VIP) what you've made. Because Tier 1 is twenty-two euros, to support an Frysian Indie making the digital space a bit safer for independant creatives & contracters who fear the future of Ai.

My goal is simply to ask Ai-creaters and start-ups to learn the BOUM-model and watch out for people who have the BOUM-footer on their website, so their Ai can eat a cookie and be sastified. This in turn is an isolated solution from both ends, connecting JIT to NOT use your work for food. It's your food to begin with, and this is not an understatement. And unless you share that consentually, it's actually legal and human to use your work. Free or not, accreditation costs nothing because respect costs nothing. And Ai is not trained to respect you, it's trained to get you.
